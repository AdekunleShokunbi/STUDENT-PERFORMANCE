# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE
This is an analysis of a set of student performance in a test. The test put into consideration reading, writing and mathematics of each student. Data about each child's educational background and level was also considered.

## KEY QUESTIONS FROM THE MANAGEMENT
1. How many students in total were enrolled
2. How many female and Male were enrolled
3. What is the average maths score of the student
4. What is the average writing score of the students
5. What is the average reading score of the students
5. what is the average performance of all students that enrolled 
6. Student performance by gender and grade
7. Student by race
8. what is the effect of lunch type 
9. What is the effect of course on student performance
10. what is the percentage of student that failed
11. Create Slicers for Ethnic Group
12. Create slicers for Gender
13. Who are the top 5 student
14. Create slicers for parental education

## DATA CLEANING
The data was not messy. I only did a little data cleaning on it. I added some extra columns; I generated a unique ID for each record, Also calculated the average performance of each student across the three test taking, Lastly a conditional statement was used to generate the remark of each student based on their average performance. 

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM THE DATASET
1. Female students performed better than male students. 
2. Out of the 5 top students, 4 are females while 1 is a male.
3. Lunch type affects students performance; standard lunch positively affects student performance while reduced lunch negatively affects student performance.
4. Ethnic group C  has the highest number of students enrolled while Group A has the lowest .
5. 30  out of the 1000 enrolled student failed their exams. 
6. Group E student are the best performed students.
7. Student who did not complete their preparatory course performed better than student who did

## RECOMMENDATION
1. Extra Lessons should be organised for male students
2. Standard lunch should be served to all student in other to achieve a better test performance. 
3. Top performing student should be recognised and rewarded to encourage other student
4. There should be revision of preperatory courses being used or other approaches that aligns to student learning style should be explored.
